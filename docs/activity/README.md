# Activity Logs

Daily development activity logs for the Elvish JetBrains plugin.

## Purpose

Activity logs track daily development work including:
- Features implemented
- Bugs fixed
- Decisions made
- Problems encountered and solutions
- Next steps identified

## File Format

Each day's activity is recorded in a file named `YYYY-MM-DD.md`:
- `2026-01-20.md` - Activity for January 20, 2026

## Template

```markdown
# Activity Log - YYYY-MM-DD

## Guidelines

1. **Create a new log** at the start of each development session
2. **Update throughout** the session as work progresses
3. **Be specific** about what changed and why
4. **Link to commits** when relevant
5. **Note blockers** and how they were resolved

## Automation

When using Claude Code or Ralph, activity logs should be created/updated automatically at the start of each session. The log serves as a record of AI-assisted development work.
